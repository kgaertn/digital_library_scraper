However, there are many factors such as classifiers, window lengths and number of channels which can make an influence on EMG-PR efficiency. Previous studies examined the effects of three different factors on EMG-PR separately. However, the combinations of three different factors (classifiers, window lengths and number of channels) may also affect the classification accuracy of EMG-PR. In present study, we discussed the effects of combinations of three different factors including classifiers, window lengths and number of channels on EMG-PR. We analyzed the different combinations of three factors. Four healthy subjects participated in this study, and they played five motions of hand and wrist in this experiment. We found that these three factors had a significant effect on EMG-PRe The performance of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of EMG-PR outperformed the performance of back propagation neural network (BPNN) (p <; 10-3). The classification accuracy of LDA is higher than support vector machine (SVM) (p <; 10-3). In addition, 200 ms window length had enough data to classify the different motions. Furthermore, we also found that five channels has a significant increase when compared to three channels (p <; 0.05).

Redundancy of features results in a decrease in classification accuracy of EMG pattern recognition and an increase in computation time for classifier to classify the pattern of EMG signal. Many researchers used feature selection method to decrease the redundancy of features. Sequential forward selection (SFS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are widely used in feature selection. This study mainly discusses the effect of two different feature selection methods (SFS and PSO) on EMG pattern recognition. We proposed three methods to compare the different influences of different feature selection methods on EMG pattern recognition. They are support vector machine (SVM) combines with none feature selection method, SVM combines with SFS (SFSSVM) and SVM combines with PSO (PSOSVM). We used SVM, SFSSVM and PSOSVM to classify 11 arm movements respectively.

Inorder to obtain high performance of Myoelectric Control (MEC), the choice of features plays an important role. The studies carried out earlier to overcome force level variation have used features which are redundant, affecting the robustness and the classification performance. This study's main objective is to assess a database's performance consisting of nine upper limb amputee subjects with EMG data recorded at three different force levels when six motions were classified using twenty different time domain features that are frequently found in the literature. Training is carried out at one force level, and the other two unknown force levels are used for testing. Out of the twenty features, the one that is the most stable is displayed for each force level. The results show that root mean square (RMS) feature outperformed other features for training at low and medium force levels, and Wilson amplitude (WAMP) feature for training at a high force level, when compared with the most widely used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The average classification accuracy for the nine amputee subjects trained with the RMS feature at low and medium force levels was 42% and 51.78% percent, respectively. For high force level, when trained using WAMP feature, an accuracy of 46.78% has been obtained. The features are verified using histogram plots.

Firstly, the initial moment of feature extraction was detected by the integral of absolute value of surface electromyography (EMG) recorded from gluteus medius muscle. Secondly, the features were extracted from the surface EMG recorded from five main muscles of lower limb. Finally, Random Forest algorithm was applied to recognize the five movement modes (level-ground walking, stair ascent, ramp ascent, stair descent, and ramp descent), while the importance of every feature was estimated by the recognition precision and Gini index.

To study a complex movement, one needs to derive useful models from the EMG data (for different muscle groups).

In this study, we analyze and verify the muscle activity related to the swinging motion of the body site with EMG. Originally, the apparent movement is a movement sense (illusion). Therefore, we interpret that the subjects present reaction to resist it when the subjects recognize the apparent movement and feel that his body site is tempted by the movement of this stimulation image. In this study, we used the feature extraction related to the biological reaction when recognizing the apparent movement by the technique that put STFT and cluster analysis together as analysis object for a low level ingredient of EMG which treated an envelope curve.

Jul 16;2016;;;324;328;During the last years, there has been a relevant progress in motor learning and functional recovery after the occurrence of a brain lesion. Rehabilitation of motor function has been associated to motor learning that occurs during repetitive, frequent and intensive training. Contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES) is a new therapy designed to improve the recovery of paretic limbs after stroke, that could provide repetitive training-based therapies and has been developed to control the upper and lower limbs movements in response to user's intentionality. Electromyography (EMG) signals reflect directly the human motion intention, so it can be used as input information to control a CCFES system. Implementation of the EMG-based pattern recognition is not easy to be accomplished due to some difficulties, among them that the activity level of each muscle for a certain motion is different between each person. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) is a kind of wearable sensors that are used to gather movement data. IMUs could provide valuable kinematic information in an EMG-based pattern recognition process to improve classification. This work describes the use of IMUS to improve detecting motion intention from EMG data. Results shows that myoelectric algorithm using information from IMUs was better in classification of seven movements at the upper-limb level that algorithm using only EMG data.;2376-8894;978-1-5090-3087-3;10.1109/BSN.2016.7516282;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7516282;;"Electromyography;Muscles;Classification algorithms;Pattern recognition;Feature extraction;Medical treatment;Sensors";;1;1;16;IEEE;21.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of intramuscular electromyogram (EMG) improved pattern classification of simultaneous wrist/hand movements compared to surface EMG. Two pattern classification methods were used in this analysis, and were trained to predict 1-DOF and 2-DOF movements involving wrist rotation, wrist flexion/extension, and hand open/close. The classification methods used were (1) a single pattern classifier discriminating between 1-DOF and 2-DOF motion classes, and (2) a parallel set of three classifiers to predict the activity of each of the 3 DOFs. We demonstrate that in this combined wrist/hand classification task, the use of intramuscular EMG significantly decreases classification error compared to surface EMG for the parallel configuration (p<;0.01), but not for the single classifier. We also show that the use of intramuscular EMG mitigates the increase in errors produced when the parallel classifier method is trained without 2-DOF motion class data.";1558-4615;978-1-4577-0216-7;10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610477;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610477;;"Electromyography;Wrist;Electrodes;Pattern recognition;Muscles;Educational institutions;Pattern classification";"Artificial Limbs;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Injections, Intramuscular;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Rotation;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wrist";46;;18;IEEE;26.

Jul 09;2009;;;1;4;This paper presents the development of a novel application using motion analysis techniques to measure tooth movement in 3D space. Measuring the relative displacements of teeth under load allows a greater understanding of the mechanical properties of the periodontal ligament (PDL). Two marker clusters were fixed onto the measured tooth and the reference tooth via orthodontic brackets and movements were captured using two 60 Hz infrared motion camera units. Software was developed to calculate 3D tooth displacements and rotations. The system accuracy (i.e. percentage of maximum absolute error in range/measurement range), in the 20-200 mum ranges, was plusmn1.17%, plusmn1.67% and plusmn1.31% for the diamond markers in x, y and z directions, while the system accuracy for the spherical markers was plusmn1.81%, plusmn2.37% and plusmn1.39%. The system repeatability (i.e. maximum standard deviation in the measurement range) measured under the different days, light intensity and temperatures for five times, carried out step up and then step down measurements for the same step size, was plusmn1.7 mum, plusmn2.3 mum and plusmn1.9 mum for the diamond markers, and plusmn2.6 mum, plusmn3.9 mum and plusmn1.9 mum for the spherical markers in x, y and z directions, respectively. The system resolution was 10 mum. These results demonstrate that the motion analysis system can measure micro-displacement accurately such as tooth displacement and could potentially be useful in many other applications.;2151-7622;978-1-4244-2901-1;10.1109/ICBBE.2009.5162401;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5162401;;"Motion analysis;Motion measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Teeth;Size measurement;Displacement measurement;Mechanical variables measurement;Mechanical factors;Ligaments;Page description languages";;;;15;IEEE;14.

To enhance generalization of EMG based pattern recognition (PR), this work proposed a novel fault-tolerant algorithm based on conventional liner discriminant analysis (LDA). Based on two patterns of EMG collection (static data and dynamic data), the most accurate feature set was first selected in static data to guarantee basic performance of LDA. Detections of LDA formed a decision stream, and provided later analysis with information of movement and muscle activity of lower limb. A BP classifier was trained based on the decision stream and features set to recover misclassification of LDA when interference occurred. Both LDA and BP were trained on static data. Dynamic data were set to imitate instability of EMG in realistic application such as different force intensity and muscle fatigue. The proposed algorithm was tested on a EMG based PR system. 4 able-bodied subjects participated in the experiment. The enhancement in classification accuracy ranged from 7.52% to 13.94% over subjects compared with unoptimized system. After EMG channels reduced, this enhancement ranged from 9.01% to 27.35%, which significantly improved classification performance under limited condition. These results suggested that the proposed algorithm yield excellent performance in improving the generalization of EMG based PR.;2379-7711;978-1-7281-9010-5;10.1109/CYBER50695.2020.9279159;"National Key R&D Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1300505); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9279159;"electromyography;pattern recognition;lower limb;generalization";"Electromyography;Classification algorithms;Muscles;Electrodes;Heuristic algorithms;Feature extraction;Exoskeletons";;4;;22;IEEE;11 Dec 2020;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

The aim of this work was to combine only movements with similar courses in the extremities by a suitable cluster analysis. For each test person, model body descriptions of 21 body elements are available, each of which is represented in three-dimensional time series. For optimization, the MoCap data are first compared using time warp edit distance (TWED) and clustered using an agglomerative hierarchical procedure.

Jul 22;2022;7;4;9613;9619;Electromyography (EMG) signals have been employed for continuous movement decoding in recent years. However, several studies demonstrated that due to physiological factors, the EMG signals of amputees were poorer with respect to that of the able-bodied subjects. Our previous study demonstrated that the joint movements affected the performance of EMG pattern recognition. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the movement of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and wrist joints have effects on the performance of EMG continuous movement decoding. Six able-bodied subjects performed MCP and wrist flexion/extension simultaneously or independently with the MCP and wrist joints unconstrained (MWJU) and constrained (MWJC), while the EMG signals of the four forearm muscles were recorded. The musculoskeletal model was used to predict the joint angles from EMG signals. The performance of continuous movement decoding was quantified by the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between the measured and predicted joint angles. The results showed that the MWJC significantly reduced the prediction performance of continuous movement for all subjects when compared to the MWJU. The average r values of the wrist and MCP flexion/extension decreased from 0.89 to 0.82 and 0.86 to 0.52, respectively. The average NRMSE values of the wrist and MCP flexion/extension increased from 0.18 to 0.21 and 0.22 to 0.31, respectively.

Wearable sensors have been used in many healthcare applications to monitor patients at home and throughout their rehabilitation. Data collected from wearable sensors allow monitoring of patient recovery during rehabilitation and assist clinicians in diagnosing. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) is considered as an assessment criterion for various disease conditions. Wearable devices enable the collection of information associated with different range of movement (ROM) tests that measure ADL. In an ambulatory monitoring setting, the volume of data collected by wearable sensors can become complex and challenging to process. Extraction of ROM tests can be laboursome, and often fraught with misclassification of movement. Hence it is difficult to analyse and make conclusions/predictions from movement datasets using manual assessment techniques. This paper examines whether ROM tests can be automatically detected and extracted from wearable sensor data using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.This research examines and discusses clinical trial data collected from patients suffering from Axial SpondyloArthritis (AxSpA). AxSpA is a disease that affects spinal cord mobility. In this trial, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors are attached to the lower back and neck of the patient, and data corresponding to clinical trial movements are recorded. An AI system is trained and tested using these datasets, and the prediction accuracy of the system is examined.

The impact of shoulder abduction loading on EMG-based intention detection of hand opening and closing after stroke;"Y. Lan; J. Yao; J. P. A.

A possible solution for this problem is to classify surface Electromyography (EMG) signals generated by hand movements and uses that to implement Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). However, EMG usually presents an abnormal muscle coactivation pattern shown as increased coupling between muscles within and/or across joints after stroke. The resulting Abnormal Muscle Synergies (AMS) could make the classification more difficult in individuals with stroke, especially when attempting to use the hand together with other joints in the paretic arm. Therefore, this study is aimed at identifying the impact of AMS following stroke on EMG pattern recognition between two hand movements. In an effort to achieve this goal, 7 chronic hemiparetic chronic stroke subjects were recruited and asked to perform hand opening and closing movements at their paretic arm while being either fully supported by a virtual table or loaded with 25% of subject's maximum shoulder abduction force. During the execution of motor tasks EMG signals from the wrist flexors and extensors were simultaneously acquired. Our results showed that increased synergy-induced activity at elbow flexors, induced by increasing shoulder abduction loading, deteriorated the performance of EMG pattern recognition for hand opening for those with a weak grasp strength and EMG activity. However, no such impact on hand closing has yet been observed possibly because finger/wrist flexion is facilitated by the shoulder abduction-induced flexion synergy.;1558-4615;978-1-4577-1589-1;10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091027;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091027;;"Electromyography;Shoulder;Loading;Muscles;Pattern recognition;Elbow;Force";"Algorithms;Electromyography;Hand;Humans;Middle Aged;Movement";5;;11;IEEE;1 Dec 2011;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

For this purpose, EMG signals from biceps brachii and forearm muscles during ten different movements of the arm and the hand are acquired from a twenty four years old male subject. These signals are modelled with both AR and fractal modelling approaches, and these models are studied for pattern recognition purposes via artificial neural networks. The results indicate that the contraction factor in fractal modelling can be used as a criterion for pattern recognition. However, the AR model parameters yield better results. As a further approach, the contraction factors obtained from fractal modelling are modelled as the outcome of an AR process and these AR model coefficients are also studied for EMG pattern recognition.;1520-6149;0-7803-6293-4;10.1109/ICASSP.2000.860183;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=860183;;"Fractals;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Artificial neural networks;Muscles;Electrodes;Biomedical engineering;Prosthetics;Robots;Signal analysis";;1;;15;IEEE;06.

While large scale deformations or fast movements are captured by the skeleton pose and approximate surface skinning, true small scale deformations or are captured by fitting the surface to the silhouette. We further propose a novel optimization scheme for skeleton-based pose estimation that exploits the skeleton's tree structure to split the optimization problem into a local one and a lower dimensional global one.

This paper investigates the ability of pattern recognition to resolve movements that are simultaneous and dynamically changing and compares the use of surface and untargeted intramuscular EMG signals for this purpose. Ten able-bodied subjects participated in the study. Both EMG types were recorded concurrently from the right forearm. The subjects were instructed to track dynamic contraction profiles using single and combined degrees of freedom in three trials. During trials one and two, the amplitude and the frequency of the profile were kept constant (nonmodulated data), and during trial three, the two parameters were modulated (modulated data). The results showed that the performance was up to 93% for nonmodulated tasks, but highly depended on the nature of the data used. Surface and untargeted intramuscular EMG had equal performance for data of similar nature (nonmodulated), but the performance of intramuscular EMG decreased, compared to surface, when tested on modulated data. However, the results of intramuscular recordings obtained in this study are promising for future use of implantable electrodes, because, besides the value added in terms of potential chronic implantation, the performance is theoretically the same as for surface EMG provided that enough information is captured in the recordings. Nevertheless, care should be taken when training the system since data obtained from selective recordings probably need more training data to generalize to new signals.;1558-0210;;10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2248750;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6476027;"Classifiers;dynamic movement;intramuscular electromyography (EMG);pattern recognition;simultaneous movement";"Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Torque;Muscles;Electrodes;Training;Educational institutions";"Adaptation, Physiological;Adult;Algorithms;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Male;Muscle Contraction;Muscle, Skeletal;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Young Adult";35;;32;IEEE;7 Mar 2013;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

This work aims to design and develop a HAL based on Electromyogram (EMG) signals. The EMG signal is a biomedical signal that measures electrical currents generated by muscles. These signals can be used for clinical/biomedical applications if advanced methods for detection, decomposition, processing, and classification are available. The pattern of the EMG signal produced may differ depending on the activity of the muscle movement. Four types of biceps muscle activities are identified using the signal pattern generated from raw surface EMG data. Threshold detection method and pattern recognition method were carried out and it is found that pattern recognition method is more generalized method for classification as threshold method is user dependent. The overall classification rate of about (80-83) % obtained using LDA and a classification rate of more than 90% obtained using ANN.

Jan 20;2020;50;1;32;41;Pattern-recognition-based myoelectric control systems are not yet widely available due to their limited robustness in real-life situations. Some postprocessing methods were introduced to improve the robustness in previous studies, but there is lack of investigation into movement transition phases. This article presents a novel postprocessing method based on movement pattern transition (MPT) detection. An image-based index is used to quantify the similarity of adjacent feature matrices from high-density surface electromyogram (EMG) signals. MPT detection is implemented by applying a double threshold to the calculated index. The proposed postprocessing method is used to rectify the EMG pattern recognition decisions from the classifier by incorporating the detected information. Two representative testing schemes are used to verify the robustness of the proposed method against force level variation and consecutive nonstop task performance. The proposed method achieved mean classification accuracy improvements of 7.33% and 10.91% with respect to the baseline performance of a raw classifier (without any postprocessing) in the two testing schemes. It also outperformed other common postprocessing methods (p < 0.05). Considering both the accuracy improvement and time efficiency for rapid responses to MPT, the proposed method could be a potential option for postprocessing to enhance the robustness of myoelectric control.;2168-2305;;10.1109/THMS.2019.2953262;"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1005001); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936336;"Human–computer interface;movement pattern transition (MPT);myoelectric control;pattern recognition;postprocessing";"Task analysis;Electromyography;Robustness;Pattern recognition;Indexes;Force;Electrodes";;14;;38;IEEE;18 Dec 2019;;;IEEE;IEEE Journals

Jul 21;2021;6;4;7217;7224;In human-machine interaction systems, continuous movement estimation methods occupy an important position because they are more natural and intuitive than pattern-recognition methods. Essentially, arm position is decided by the shoulder and elbow joint angles. However, the various deformations of muscles around the shoulder and elbow often lead to difficulties in sensor fixation, which results in a loss of synchronization between the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and joint angles. In order to accurately estimate movement angles using sEMG in situations where the sEMG is not synchronized with joint angles, we utilized a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network rather than other deep learning methods to estimate non-dominant arm movements, based on the sEMG signal from the dominant arm. This estimation protocol was designed to avoid a multiplicity of sensors and to simulate more complicated loss of synchronization problems). The performance of the Bi-LSTM was compared with multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and a long short-term memory network (LSTM). The Pearson correlation coefficient (cc) between the estimated and target joint angle sequences was calculated to evaluate the performance of each neural network. The Wilcoxon signed-rank results showed that the Bi-LSTM model significantly outperformed the MLP, CNN, and LSTM models (tested with completely untrained newly recorded free movements).;2377-3766;;10.1109/LRA.2021.3097272;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:#U1613222,#61773110,#82050410452,#81850410557,#81927804,#U1913601); Shenzhen Basic Research(grant numbers:#SGLH20180625142402055,#JCYJ20170413152804728,#JCYJ20180507182508857); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:#N181906001,#N2119008); Hong Kong ITF Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme(grant numbers:GHP/055/18SZ); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484719;"Machine learning for robot control;continuous movement estimation;surface electromyography;free movements test";"Shoulder;Elbow;Synchronization;Robot sensing systems;Estimation;Protocols;Electromyography";;31;;37;IEEE;14.

These latter are specific to the type of movement and can be classified by pattern recognition algorithms. However, phantom mobility generates fatigue that could impact classification metrics. This study explored whether daily phantom movement training at home with no other feedback than inherent somatosensory information can impact the classification success rate. Kinematics and muscle activity were compared between before and after a two-month home training in six major upper limb amputees. Surface EMG patterns were classified to quantify a potential change in the features space with training. Our results showed that this type of training induces faster, smoother, and richer phantom mobility. However, classification metrics did not change with training. When including the new types of movements achievable after training, accuracy did not decrease, indicating that muscle activation patterns associated with these movements were sufficiently different not to interfere with the already existing movement classes. Thus, although phantom training with only somatosensory feedback increases the overall phantom movement capacity, it does not increase the classification success rate.

These features describe signal morphology and nonlinear characteristics, power spreading in EMG wavelet scalograms and spectral coherence. Principal component approach is applied separately for static and extension trial to reduce the number of features before discrimination. The discrimination between subjects is done in a two-dimensional space by applying cluster analysis to the best discriminating principal components. The discrimination power of the used method was estimated with EMG and acceleration data measured from 56 patients with PD and 59 healthy controls.

We present here an alternative, noninvasive approach utilizing piezoelectric films configured as highly sensitive motion detectors. These film strips attached to the floor of the rodent cage produce an electrical output in direct proportion to the distortion of the material. During sleep, movement associated with breathing is the predominant gross body movement and, thus, output from the piezoelectric transducer provided an accurate respiratory trace during sleep. During wake, respiratory movements are masked by other motor activities. An automatic pattern recognition system was developed to identify periods of sleep and wake using the piezoelectric generated signal. Due to the complex and highly variable waveforms that result from subtle postural adjustments in the animals, traditional signal analysis techniques were not sufficient for accurate classification of sleep versus wake. Therefore, a novel pattern recognition algorithm was developed that successfully distinguished sleep from wake in approximately 95% of all epochs. This algorithm may have general utility for a variety of signals in biomedical and engineering applications. This automated system for monitoring sleep is noninvasive, inexpensive, and may be useful for large-scale sleep studies including genetic approaches towards understanding sleep and sleep disorders, and the rapid screening of the efficacy of sleep or wake promoting drugs;1558-2531;;10.1109/TBME.2006.886938;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4067108;"Activity;automated;behavior;classification;instrumentation;mice;noninvasive;respiration;wake";"Pattern recognition;Sleep;Rodents;Signal generators;Animals;Piezoelectric films;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Motion detection;Detectors";"Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Mice;Mice, Inbred AKR;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Mice, Inbred DBA;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Polysomnography;Respiratory Mechanics;Sleep;Transducers";102;;24;IEEE;22.

The application of pattern recognition based sEMG control scheme has shown massive potential in natural and robust myoelectric control. The classical pattern recognition model for myoelectric control includes two independent processes: training process and testing process. The rules creating the classical classifiers remain unchanged. Most powered devices based on the sEMG signals use the classical pattern recognition model to identify the users' upper-limb movement commands. Towards myoelectric practical application in future, identifying human movements stably and accurately for a long period of time is more meaningful. In this study, two experiment protocols for sEMG measurement are adopted. We investigate the recognition effect of classical pattern recognition model for myoelectric control systems in the shortterm and long-term use respectively. Three classical classification algorithms are applied in our investigation. Experiment results show the classical pattern recognition model works well at the early stage. However, there appears the declining tendency of recognition accuracy over time in the both experiment protocols. The results presented in this study can contribute to investigating the practical use of pattern recognition based sEMG control scheme.;2688-0938;978-1-7281-4094-0;10.1109/CAC48633.2019.8996909;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8996909;"surface electromyography (sEMG);movement pattern recognition;the classical pattern recognition model;longterm use";"Pattern recognition;Testing;Protocols;Classification algorithms;Training;Electrodes;Control systems";;;;11;IEEE;13.

It is unknown how the central nervous system (CNS) transits from the ongoing involuntary motor program of tremor to the execution of voluntary reaching movement. In this paper, muscle synergy analysis was used to unveil the motor module transitions from resting tremor to compound movement. Three tremor symptom dominant PD patients performed tasks of targeted forward reaching movements with background tremor. Kinematics and surface electromyography (EMG) of six muscles were recorded. Synergy vectors and time profiles were analyzed using EMG data during resting tremor and forward reaching. Results revealed that the representative vector of tremor remained unchanged during performance of voluntary movement. Other synergy vectors of tremor were modified to accommodate vectors of movement synergies. The merge of tremor module with movement module could be explained by a procedure of linear combination. The distribution of timing of movement initiation with respect to tremor cycle displayed a weak sign of clusters. The analysis suggested that the CNS combined two motor modules in order to initiate a voluntary movement with background tremor. More extensive analysis with a larger number of patients needs to be carried out to confirm these findings.;1948-3554;978-1-7281-4337-8;10.1109/NER49283.2021.9441369;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61361160415,81271684); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441369;;"Parkinson's disease;Neural engineering;Kinematics;Central nervous system;Muscles;Electromyography;Timing";;;;12;IEEE;02.

Six EMG channels were collected from non-targeted forearm muscles of four healthy subjects. Subjects were prompted to perform eight medium force isometric repetitions of the following contractions: wrist flexion/extension, wrist pronation/supination, hand open/close, and no movement (rest). Control performances were measured during a one-dimensional position-tracking task using a custom-made graphical user interface.

The posture of each frame is distinguished into the pattern of the indexed labels, and we therefore try to index each motion data. Firstly, we reduce the number of dimensions of motion data with PCA (Principal Components Analysis) and do clustering. Next, a trained dictionary is consisted of the indexed motion data. Finally, SVM (Support Vector Machine) distinguishes the test data by using the dictionary.

We are pioneering the use of a unique combination of wavelet scattering transform (WST) and attention mechanisms adopted from recent sequence modelling developments of deep neural networks for the classification of EMG patterns. Our approach utilizes WST, which decomposes the signal into different frequency components, and then applies a non-linear operation to the wavelet coefficients to create a more robust representation of the extracted features. This is coupled with different variations of attention mechanisms, typically employed to focus on the most important parts of the input data by considering weighted combinations of all input vectors. By applying this technique to EMG signals, we hypothesized that improvement in the classification accuracy could be achieved by focusing on the correlation between the different muscles’ activation states associated with the different hand movements.

Nov 20;2020;28;11;2507;2514;Reliable control of assistive devices using surface electromyography (sEMG) remains an unsolved task due to the signal's stochastic behavior that prevents robust pattern recognition for real-time control. Non-representative samples lead to inherent class overlaps that generate classification ripples for which the most common alternatives rely on post-processing and sample discard methods that insert additional delays and often do not offer substantial improvements. In this paper, a resilient classification pipeline based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) was used to classify 17 different upper-limb movements through sEMG signals from a total of 99 trials derived from three different databases. The method was compared to a baseline ELM and a sample discarding (DISC) method and proved to generate more stable and consistent classifications. The average accuracy boost of ≈ 10% in all databases lead to average weighted accuracy rates higher as 53,4% for amputees and 89,0% for non-amputee volunteers.

Thus electromyogram (EMG) can be used as control signals of assisted devices for people with disabilities. Pattern-recognition-based myoelectric control systems have rarely been designed for stroke survivors. Aiming at developing such a system for improved stroke rehabilitation, this study assessed detection of the affected limb's movement intention using high-density surface EMG recording and pattern-recognition techniques. Surface EMG signals comprised of 89 channels were recorded from 12 hemiparetic stroke subjects while they tried to perform 20 different arm, hand, and finger/thumb movements involving the affected limb. A series of pattern-recognition algorithms were implemented to identify the intended tasks of each stroke subject. High classification accuracies (96.1% ± 4.3%) were achieved, indicating that substantial motor control information can be extracted from paretic muscles of stroke survivors.

For solving multimodal optimization problems, numerous niching algorithms have been proposed to locate and track multiple optima. However, most of these algorithms need a very strict choice of the population size parameter. This paper presents a new niching differential evolution algorithm which adaptively adjusts population size during the evolution. Particularly, we propose three techniques for performance enhancement: a heuristic clustering method, a population adaptation strategy, and an auxiliary movement strategy for the best individuals. The algorithm divides the population into several subpopulations and adaptively adjust the number of individuals and subpopulations according to the evolutionary state. In this way, the diversity of population is increased, while the computational cost is reduced.

To this end, this article proposes a stacking integration-based EMG signal model for the waist, which introduces the stacking integration framework into EMG signal recognition for the first time, using  ${K}$ -nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF)-master, XGboost, and LightGBM algorithms as base learners and decision tree (DT) model as a meta-learner to construct the integrated model. The complex feature information contained in the EMG signal is correlated with different waist movements to construct feature datasets with high correlation, and the training set is divided by using the fivefold cross-validation method to reduce the overfitting problem during the repeated training of the integrated model. Using the integrated model proposed in this article, the generalization ability of the model can be effectively improved and the recognition accuracy of EMG signals can be improved.

Therefore, modeling of the operator and his highly redundant link mechanisms is essential for such a simulation. With a predefined analytical biomechanical model of the operator it is feasible to compute the position of any end-effector for a given link configuration. Much more difficult is to find the solution of the inverse task: Given a point in world coordinates, determine the corresponding joint angles. A corresponding learning procedure is based on local linear mapping between link coordinates and effector coordinates where the global mapping remains highly nonlinear. The training data of the human motions were recorded from different subjects equipped with markers on proper anatomical landmarks at the body using a system of four IR cameras for motion analysis. Learning of the inverse kinematics is done by fuzzy clustering and local linear (affine) fuzzy models being smoothly connected. Moreover a simple operator dynamics and well defined restrictions on joint angles and contributing joint torques are included in the model.;;0-7803-8109-2;10.1109/ROSE.2003.1218707;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1218707;;"Kinematics;Humans;Joints;Motion analysis;Machinery production industries;Ergonomics;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Training data;Cameras";;;;6;IEEE;04.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of pattern recognition models classifying motion in constrained laboratory environments significantly drops when used for detecting dynamic unconstrained movements. The objectives of this study were to quantity how various motion factors affect arm muscle activations during dynamic motion, and to use these motion factors and EMG signals for detecting interaction forces between the person and the environment during motion. The results quantity how EMG features change significantly with variations in arm positions, interaction forces, and motion velocities. The results also show that pattern recognition models were able to detect intended characteristics of motion based solely on EMG signals.

Determining how to decode the information inside EMG signals robustly and accurately is a key problem for which we urgently need a solution. Recently, many EMG pattern recognition tasks have been addressed using deep learning methods. In this paper, we analyze recent papers and present a literature review describing the role that deep learning plays in EMG-based HMI. An overview of typical network structures and processing schemes will be provided. Recent progress in typical tasks such as movement classification, joint angle prediction, and force/torque estimation will be introduced. New issues, including multimodal sensing, inter-subject/inter-session, and robustness toward disturbances will be discussed. We attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of current research by discussing the advantages, challenges, and opportunities brought by deep learning.

Learning vector quantization abstracts the affine motion parameters as morphological primitive units, i.e. ""letters""; clustering techniques derive sequences of letters as ""words"" for both sub-activities and the transitions occurring between them; and, finally, the arm activities are recognized in terms of sequences of certain sub-activities. Using activity cycles from six kinds of arm movements, i.e. slow and fast pounding, striking, swinging, swirling and stirring, which were not available during training, the performance achieved is perfect (100%) if one allows, as should be the case for invariance purposes, slow and fast pounding video sequences to be recognized as one and the same type of activity.";;0-7695-1602-5;10.1109/AFGR.2002.1004178;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1004178;;"Motion analysis;Video sequences;Motion detection;Signal mapping;Speech;Machine vision;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Tracking;Humans";;3;;11;IEEE;07.

Jul 23;2023;11;;68410;68420;In the analysis of surface electromyography signals(sEMG), the extraction of suitable features is one of the key factors affecting pattern recognition. The aim of this paper is to propose an improved sEMG feature extraction algorithm based on muscle activity regions. The fusion of muscle activity intensity on the basis of muscle activity regions compensates for the low accuracy of the original features for the recognition of similar movements. In this paper, the sEMG signals of five leg movements were collected, including two similar movements: upstairs and downstairs, standing and sitting. The classification performance of the features before and after the improvement was tested with six classifiers. It proves that the new characteristic, active muscle position and intensity (AMPI), greatly improves the classification accuracy of similar movements. The paper also compares the new features with the traditional eight classification features. The results show that the new features are at the forefront of the classification performance, with a very small difference in classification accuracy of 4.1% compared to the best performing features. This confirms the high practical value of the new features. New features are still based on the mapping relationship between movement patterns and active muscle regions. This provides new ideas for the feature extraction method of sEMG signals. In addition, compared with the traditional features, the new feature still have the ability to reduce the dimension, which provides a more applicable feature extraction method for the application of multi-channel electromyogram(EMG) signals acquisition devices and high-density electrodes.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3291108;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51865056); National Natural Science Foundation of China-Xinjiang Joint(grant numbers:2020E0259); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168895;"Surface electromyography signals;feature extraction;active muscle regions;similar movements;pattern recognition";"Muscles;Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Electromyography;Electrodes;Exoskeletons;Skin;Pattern recognition";;2;;32;CCBYNCND;30.

Feb 13;2013;35;3;582;596;Temporal segmentation of human motion into plausible motion primitives is central to understanding and building computational models of human motion. Several issues contribute to the challenge of discovering motion primitives: the exponential nature of all possible movement combinations, the variability in the temporal scale of human actions, and the complexity of representing articulated motion. We pose the problem of learning motion primitives as one of temporal clustering, and derive an unsupervised hierarchical bottom-up framework called hierarchical aligned cluster analysis (HACA). HACA finds a partition of a given multidimensional time series into m disjoint segments such that each segment belongs to one of k clusters. HACA combines kernel k-means with the generalized dynamic time alignment kernel to cluster time series data. Moreover, it provides a natural framework to find a low-dimensional embedding for time series. HACA is efficiently optimized with a coordinate descent strategy and dynamic programming. Experimental results on motion capture and video data demonstrate the effectiveness of HACA for segmenting complex motions and as a visualization tool. We also compare the performance of HACA to state-of-the-art algorithms for temporal clustering on data of a honey bee dance.

This is useful in developing intelligent artificial myoelectric controllers for both healthy patients as well as amputees requiring an intelligent artificial hand.

Aug 21;2021;;;1;6;In tennis there are two basic shots (forehand and backhand), which are two of key elements to win points. Sophisticated equipments, such as motion capture systems, enable one to record both the tennis player's movements and tennis racket. The 3D data may be used to define the perfect shot model or to give the directions to the player how to reach to this model and which aspects of impact should be improved. Clustering analysis can result in understanding the phases of a tennis player move and, as a consequence, the improvement of his/her play. Using the memberships obtained in the fuzzy clustering process one can evaluate the quality of a player's move and potentially estimate the player's progress. The main objective of this study is to apply the fuzzy c-means algorithm utilizing the dynamic time warping-based distance to cluster analysis of tennis shots. Both shots were taken into the consideration. The analysis consists of forty moves. Based on the 3D data of the tennis racket positions, the clustering was performed for subsequent two, three, and four clusters. The obtained results clearly show that clustering with two clusters is the most appropriate for analysing tennis shots. The model of a perfect shot was obtained. It is universal and does not depend on the player's height. Based on the model, it is possible to deduce technical differences in the players' shots. This analysis gives the directions for improvements of the shot technique. The advantage of the clustering of our approach is that we can get information to what degree the athlete should still correct his/her shots.

So it is advantaged in the application of bilateral rehabilitation, where hemiplegic patients can perform rehabilitation training to their impaired limbs following the motion of intact limbs by using a certain training tool. In this paper, we discussed the motion pattern recognition of human upper limb based on the sEMG signals. The main features of motion patterns based on sEMG signals are extracted via wavelet packet transform. Because the sEMG signal is a kind of non-stationary signal and there are many factors which can affect it like inherent noise, cross talk and so on. Therefore, a simple new method to obtain the trend of sEMG with weighted peaks as features was proposed and support vector machine (SVM) is utilized as the classifier.

This paper focuses on robust implementation in a wearable platform-based inertial sensors enhance opportunities for exploring day-to-day changes of wrist joint when performing dart-throwing motion. The kinematic characterization of the underlying movement is described in terms of time-series quaternions measured from gyroscope data. The distance metrics between these representations are used to compare quantitatively wrist kinematic performance against clinical observations. A clinical trial was conducted engaging five normal subjects and 10 patients undergoing a series of post-surgical rehabilitation programs. The approach classifies effectively the patients from normal subjects and alleviates the need for range of motion measurements of the wrist joint implying the quaternion trajectory associated with classical dynamic time warping as a useful kinematic description for dart thrower's movement in assessing and characterizing the wrist performance. Clustering and classification results confirm that this proposed method is well-correlated with clinical assessments based on high positive correlation coefficients.

Moreover, effectively extracting spatial and temporal information from sensor temporal data has been a big challenge in machine learning and deep learning. When faced with high-dimensional small sample data, Machine Learning representation learning methods offer advantages over Deep Neural Networks. However, most machine learning approaches rely on feature extraction methods and do not have an advantage in the information extraction of temporal information. In contrast, temporally valid data can be better captured by neural networks. We propose a hybrid network of CNN-GRU and random forest based on existing methods. The CNN-GRU network will be used to fuse temporal and spatial information, and the random forest decision tree will guide the neural network in the lower layer of representation learning. This hybrid network captures the temporal and spatial information of the EMG signal very well.

A way to reduce the complexity of a signal is to use clusters to resize them to a smaller space and then perform the classification. A classification improvement was verified by clustering the electromyographic signal and comparing it with the possible movements that can be performed. In this study, the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering was used. The basic idea is to give prior information to the final classifier so the posterior classification has fewer classes, diminishing his complexity.

In contrast to existing decomposition methods which only support short registration periods or single-channel recordings of signals of constant muscle effort, the decomposition software EMG-LODEC (ElectroMyoGram LOng-term DEComposition) is especially designed for multichannel long-term recordings of signals of slight muscle movements. A wavelet-based, hierarchical cluster analysis algorithm estimates the number of classes [motor units (MUs)], distinguishes single MUAPs from superpositions, and sets up the shape of the template for each class. Using three channels and a weighted averaging method to track action potential (AP) shape changes improve the analysis. In the last step, nonclassified segments, i.e., segments containing superimposed APs, are decomposed into their units using class-mean signals. Based on experiments on simulated and long-term recorded EMG signals, our software is capable of providing reliable decompositions with satisfying accuracy. EMG-LODEC is suitable for the study of MU discharge patterns and recruitment order in healthy subjects and patients during long-term measurements.;1558-2531;;10.1109/TBME.2002.807321;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179132;;"Software packages;Electromyography;Wavelet coefficients;Muscles;Shape;Signal design;Wavelet analysis;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Recruitment";"Action Potentials;Adult;Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electromyography;False Negative Reactions;False Positive Reactions;Female;Fingers;Humans;Internet;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Motor Neurons;Movement;Muscle, Skeletal;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Porphyrins;Reproducibility of Results;Shoulder;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Software";65;;36;IEEE;19.

Advances in wearable technology (miniaturization, lower costs), and machine learning techniques as well as recently developed self-monitoring movements, such as the Quantified Self, are facilitating mass adoption. However, EE estimations are affected by a person's body weight (BW). BW is a confounding variable preventing meaningful individual and group comparisons. In this paper we present a machine learning approach for BW normalization and activities clustering. In our approach to activity-specific EE modeling, we adopt a genetic algorithm-based clustering scheme, not only based on accelerometer (ACC) features, but also on allometric coefficients derived from 19 subjects performing a wide set of lifestyle and gym activities.

Most existing methods work on image pixels or color segmentations which are computation expensive. Some methods require extensive manual input, static cameras, and/or rigid scenes. In this paper we propose a fully automatic segmentation method based on sequential clustering of sparse image features. The sparseness makes the method computation efficient. We use both edge and corner features to capture the outline of the foreground objects. Sequential linear regression is applied to the movement sequences of image features in order to compute the motion parameters for foreground objects and background layers, and consider the temporal smoothness simultaneously.

Two pattern recognition experiments were performed taking into account eight healthy subjects. The first involved the direct comparison of classification performances using feature computed over 150, 100 and 50 ms window length for eight class of shoulder movements. In the second one, a feature fusing scheme, based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA), was used to investigate whether pattern recognition architectures (PRAs), i.e. support vector machine, were able to boost their performances when 50 ms features were used as testing set. The rationale behind such investigations grounds on the lack of consensus regarding the most suitable window length for myoelectic pattern recognition. No drop of accuracy was observed in the first experiment for the three different windows length, maintaining values around 90%. Moreover, as observed in the second experiment, the CCA feature fusing scheme enhanced the performances of the PRAs when working over 50 ms features, reaching comparable results with feature at 150 ms.

Thus, this study aims to explore the generalization of classifier to develop a stable classification model that does not require relearning, even if it is used by other people. We propose a new feature extraction method to diminish the influence of limb position on sEMG-based PR. Specifically, the sEMG features are extracted directly from time domain. This condition is accomplished by using Fourier transform properties, difference, and the sum of squares differences. The best offline cross-validation accuracy (CVA) results are 88.775% training data from the tenth subject and testing data from the fifth subject in the NinaPro dataset. The best online CVA is 99%, and the movement selection time is 47.036 ± 1.028 ms.

ACA extends standard kernel k-means clustering in two ways: (1) the cluster means contain a variable number of features, and (2) a dynamic time warping (DTW) kernel is used to achieve temporal invariance.

In LBH, the movement of each star depends mainly on the step size generated by the Levy distribution. Therefore, the star explores an area far from the current black hole when the value step size is big, and vice versa. The performance of LBH in terms of finding the best solutions, prevent getting stuck in local optimum, and the convergence rate has been evaluated based on several unimodal and multimodal numerical optimization problems. Additionally, LBH is then tested using six real datasets available from UCI machine learning laboratory. The experimental outcomes obtained indicated the designed algorithm's suitability for data clustering, displaying effectiveness and robustness.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937021;"Novel Hybrid Harmony Search Algorithm With Nomadic People Optimizer Algorithm for Global Optimization and Feature Selection(grant numbers:RDU190334); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809737;"Optimization;data clustering;black hole;levy flight;metaheuristic;computational intelligence";"Clustering algorithms;Optimization;Linear programming;Data mining;Clustering methods;Machine learning;Data analysis";;60;;76;CCBY;22.

However, these systems cannot estimate pedestrian altitude because of the divergence of inertial altitude channels and the complexity of pedestrian movement patterns. To address this challenge, this article proposes an indoor pedestrian altitude estimation method utilizing the inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor installed on the pedestrian’s foot. Specifically, the method calculates the height difference of steps with the inertial navigation system (INS), extended Kalman filter (EKF), and zero velocity update (ZUPT)—named the IEZ framework. Then, a convolutional neural networks-support vector machine (CNN-SVM) model is developed to accurately identify complex pedestrian motion patterns, including horizontal walking, running, walking stairs, standing, and taking elevators and escalators. Next, the height difference is adaptively corrected according to the motion modes. For horizontal walking and standing, the height difference based on the IEZ framework is revised and remains unchanged; for walking or running stairs, the pedestrian altitude is determined by the stair step model. In the case of taking elevators or escalators, the vertical displacement is obtained by integrating the barometric height measured as EKF observations with the double integral value of the vertical acceleration. Experimental results show that the CNN-SVM model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.8%, and a positioning error for pedestrian altitude estimation of less than 0.6 m with an indoor walking distance of approximately 500 m.";1558-1748;;10.1109/JSEN.2024.3355163;"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3904604); 03 Special and 5G Project of Jiangxi Province in 2022(grant numbers:20224ABC03W03); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M700385); GuangDong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2021A1515110577); Central Guidance on Local Science and Technology Development Fund of ShanXi Province(grant numbers:YDZJSX2022B019); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10417005;"Convolutional neural networks-support vector machine (CNN-SVM);extended Kalman filter (EKF);indoor pedestrian altitude estimation;inertial sensor;motion pattern recognition";"Pedestrians;Estimation;Sensors;Legged locomotion;Stairs;Location awareness;Inertial sensors";;;;46;IEEE;30.

An obvious reason is the effect of signals of untrained classes caused by the relatively small training dataset. In order to make the classifier robust to untrained classes, a classification scheme is developed based on boosting and random forest classifiers in this paper. Meanwhile, a threshold, the post probability of the prediction, is introduced as a balance (i.e., adjust) between the accurate classification and the rejection of the samples belonging to some untrained classes. The experiments are conducted to compare with other two schemes using linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines. Surface electromyogram signals, labeled with seven isometric movements, are collected from six healthy subjects' forearm. It is shown that the proposed scheme can reach up to about 92% accuracy in recognizing trained classes and 20% for untrained classes. Through adjusting the threshold, the accuracy of rejecting untrained classes reaches up to around 80%, with small decrease in recognizing trained classes (down to 80%).

These trends will not only be helpful as hints for designing new lyric videos but also be meaningful to quantitatively reveal the thought processes of the video design professionals. To achieve this, we needed to develop or utilize several technologies. First, we developed a lyric word tracking method to capture the motion of individual lyric words. The proposed method uses the lyric text as the guiding information for word tracking to overcome the difficulties arising from the various word appearances and motions. Second, we developed a font style estimator to quantify the appearance of each word as a feature vector. Finally, we employed a music style estimator to quantify the mood of the music, e.g., “techno” and “fast.” We then analyzed feature vectors of these three style modalities collected at 3,494 time points in 100 lyric videos.

However, in this paper we will introduce semantic trajectories that use episodes as changes in emotion to enable scientists and healthcare professionals to assess the impact of surrounding environments and physiological responses directly to individuals' wellbeing. For the first time, the study explores how a trajectory can be enriched with several semantics, specifically made up of environmental (e.g. air pollution including: PM1, PM2.5, PM10, Oxidised, Reduced, NH3 and Noise, People Count in the vicinity) and physiological responses (including: EDA, HR, HRV, Body Temperature, BVP and movement), in addition to self-report wellbeing and location data collected in real-time. The proposed method divides the multi-modal sensor data semantic trajectory into individual episodes each time a change of emotion is detected. Statistical correlation analysis techniques have been applied to unravel the relationship between emotion episodes and semantics, highlighting that Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Heart Rate (HR) and self-labelled emotion are noticeably impacted by the level of air pollution in the environment.

Firstly, a data set of frames are projected into a lower dimensional space. An appearance model is learnt using a multivariate probability distribution. A novel approach to determining transition points is presented based on k-medoids, whereby appropriate points of intersection in the motion trajectory are derived as cluster centers. These points are used to segment the data into smaller subsequences. A transition matrix combined with a kernel density estimation is used to determine suitable transitions between the subsequences to develop novel motion. To facilitate real-time interactive control, conditional probabilities are used to derive motion given user commands. The user commands can come from any modality including auditory, touch, and gesture.

The body area network (BAN) formed by the nodes is a motion capture system that measures joint angles of the user at the shoulder and elbow. In order to predict the RSSI, we first show that the wireless signal experiences severe attenuation from human-body shadowing even though distances between transmitters and receiver are less than 3 meters. Second, we show that the RSSI fluctuates periodically with regular body movements (i.e., physical-therapy exercises). We then model the movements using k-means clustering and Markov chains and determine the probability distribution of the RSSI at each state in the movement. Finally, the RSSI is predicted with a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) detector. Experimental results show that the RSSI can be predicted with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.7 dB, which is an error within 4.2% of the average RSSI level, and when a prediction is made, it is valid for the next 1083 milliseconds (ms) on average.;;978-1-4673-8579-4;10.1109/ICCNC.2016.7440700;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440700;;"Prediction algorithms;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Clustering algorithms;Receivers;Elbow;Servers";;3;;19;IEEE;24 Mar 2016;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences
Dense optical Flow Computation for 2D and 3D images via multigrid on a parallel machine;E. M. Kalmoun;Ecole Nationale des Sciences Appliquees (ENSA), Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakech, Morocco;2007 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics;04. Jun 07;2007;;;21;21;Summary form only given. Optical flow computation is known to be a fundamental step in many applications in image processing, pattern recognition, data compression, and biomedical technology. The goal is to compute an approximation to the projection of the 3D motion field onto the imaging surface. I consider in this talk the problem of real-time computation of dense optical flow for 2D and 3D images by the classical Horn-Schunck model. The basic assumption of this model is that the intensity variations are weak and only due to a movement in the image plan. This constant brightness assumption leads to an ill-posed problem that can only be solved by imposing an additional constraint requiring the flow field to be smooth by means of a standard regularization approach. The Horn-Schuck model is traditionally solved via a coupled point wise relaxation. The performance is generally poor when the image sequence data are strongly textured. I will review and discuss the multigrid components for a fast and robust computation. The parallel implementation of the proposed scheme using domain partitioning shows that the algorithm scales well up to 32 processors on a cluster of AMD Opteron CPUs which consists of four-way nodes connected by an Infiniband network. I will conclude by presenting some experimental results showing the good performance of the proposed algorithm on some classical 2D test images and also for computing 3D motion from cardiac C-arm CT images.;;1-4244-1157-2;10.1109/ISCIII.2007.367355;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4218388;;"Optical computing;Image motion analysis;Concurrent computing;Parallel machines;Biomedical optical imaging;Biomedical computing;Clustering algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Data flow computing;Image processing";;;;;IEEE;04.

A System For Automatic Recognition of Hand Gestures Based on Temporal Features and Feed Forward Neural Network By Using Electromyographic Data;N.

The term “electrical biomedical signals” is used to describe the variation in electric current that results from adding up the electrical potential difference throughout a certain tissue or organ. These electrical signals have a very small amplitude and a very slow frequency. Based on shared properties, the biological signals were clustered into distinct categories. Electromyography (EMG) signals are employed for hand gesture recognition among biological signals. That's the retrieved electrical potential from the muscle fibres being recorded. Electromyographic (EMG) signals are recorded using surface electrodes. Noises are amplified as the EMG signal is recovered from the muscle fibre and transmitted through various media. Despite the explosion of available spoken and written means of communication, people still rely heavily on hand gestures when trying to convey ideas and intentions. Therefore, HCI experts agree that recognizing hand gestures is crucial (HCI). As a result, computers can now detect and respond to user-initiated movements. Denoising and amplification are used as signal pre-processing steps. There are a variety of suggested methods for obtaining these properties. Time domain features extraction. Mean, standard deviation, energy, entropy, Skewness, and kurtosis are all employed as measures of statistical dispersion. Better performance was achieved with the recommended methods, as shown by the simulation results.;;979-8-3503-4595-7;10.1109/IHCSP56702.2023.10126505;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10126505;"EMG;HCI;MSE;PSNR";"Human computer interaction;Electrodes;Electric potential;Technological innovation;Biological systems;Muscles;Feature extraction";;;;16;IEEE;25 May 2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Sep 13;2013;13;11;4329;4338;The intensity measurement of facial muscle activity can be used in several applications such as human-computer interaction and behavioral science. A new method for the intensity measurement is presented. It is based on a contactless, capacitive measurement of the movements that the facial activity produces. The muscles responsible for raising the eyebrows, lowering the eyebrows, raising the mouth corners, and pulling down the mouth corners are measured simultaneously with the capacitive method and electromyography (EMG) during controlled experiments. Each muscle is activated by 10 participants at three different intensity levels (low, medium, and high), 10 repetitions at each level. The capacitive intensity values are in good agreement with the ones registered with the EMG: average mean absolute errors are between 7% and 12% of the observed intensity range. However, compared with the EMG, the capacitive intensity values are noticed to have offsets that may be partly caused by the measurement itself and partly by the EMG reference.

In the capacitive method, it is also required to distinguish between the muscle activations originating from the same facial regions to determine which activation is taking place.

The effect of identification method based on single surface electromyography (sEMG) feature is limited. To obtain more comprehensive information about multi-movement pattern, we investigate a multi-feature fusion method based on multiple kernel learning framework. General multi-kernel learning (Generalized-MKL) algorithm is adopted to integrate different kinds of features, which takes full advantage of valuable features for movement classification. Each kind of sEMG feature is endowed with a base kernel respectively. The proposed method adaptively combines multiple features together with optimal combination weights and finds a mixed kernel to classify. In the experiment, we classify multiple different hand movements for fifteen participants, such as wrist, gross hand and finger movements. The experimental results indicate that the feature set formed by the proposed fusion method has the lowest classification error value across all the multi-feature sets. The classification error value of the proposed feature set is 2.86%-4.24% lower than the other commonly used feature combinations. It proves the effectiveness of the proposed multi-feature fusion method. The proposed method is quite promising for hand multi-movement classification with low classification error value.;1934-1768;978-9-8815-6397-2;10.23919/ChiCC.2019.8866245;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8866245;"surface electromyography (sEMG);multi-movement pattern recognition;multi-feature fusion;generalized multiple kernel learning";"Kernel;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Reactive power;Support vector machines;Wrist;Pattern classification";;1;;15;;17 Oct 2019;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

For long term use, the signal quality may decay with the change of interface impedance between electrodes and skin due to the conductive hydrogel dehydration. Besides, electrodes may shift during body movements, which causes unstable signal recordings. Methods: To improve the quality of electrophysiological signal recordings on human body surface, a type of microneedle electrode array (MEA) with microneedles around 550 μm in length was fabricated with a magnetization-induce self-assembly method. Results: Compared with the commonly used dry electrode array, the MEA has lower and more stable interface impedance, especially when the electrode-skin interface is under unstable pressures. For electrophysiological signal recording, the MEA can acquire electromyography (EMG) with significantly lower noise energy, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and higher motion-classification accuracy based on the EMG pattern-recognition method. Additionally, high quality electrocardiography (ECG) can be recorded by using the MEA, where more accurate R-peaks are extracted in different scenarios. Besides, there was no report about any discomfort like bleeding or inflammation by all the subjects. Conclusion: This research proved that the microneedles on the MEA can penetrate through the corneum and reach the epidermis of the subjects, which could avoid the influence of corneum and fix the electrode on the body surface for high-quality signal recording especially during body movements. Furthermore, the microneedles would not touch the dermis, enabling a painless signal acquisition.

Many behavioral studies have sought to increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms of locomotor adaptation by examining how people adapt to walking on a split-belt treadmill, which usually occurs within minutes. Motor adaptation can be modeled using a double exponential function to characterize the fast and slow adaptation process. Mobile brain imaging with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) now enables quantification of electrocortical dynamics during human locomotion. We recorded high-density EEG and motion capture from 30 healthy, young adults during split-belt treadmill walking. To decrease motion and muscle artifact, we incorporated a dual-electrode EEG system and neck electromyography. We fit single and double exponential models to step length symmetry and EEG spectral power to characterize the time course of split-belt adaptation. We found component clusters near the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) that had significant changes in alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) spectral power from early to late adaptation. We also found that the time constants from the neural models are generally larger than the behavioral models. These results indicate that adaptive locomotor processes in multiple brain regions continue even after behavioral plateau.;1948-3554;978-1-6654-6292-1;10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123818;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123818;"EEG;motor adaptation;mobile brain imaging";"Neuroimaging;Legged locomotion;Adaptation models;Neural engineering;Muscles;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography";;;;42;IEEE;19 May 2023;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

Conventional data imputation strategies to address the challenges of missing data, including statistical fill-in, matrix factorization and traditional machine learning approaches, are inadequate in capturing temporal variations in multivariate time series. In this paper, we investigate data imputation using bidirectional recurrent neural networks with temporal activation regularization, which can directly learn and fill in the missing data.

The proposed approach does not require a kinematic model of the person, nor any markers on the body. Instead, optical flow computed directly in the image plane is used to estimate the location of segment points. The approach is based on detecting tracking features in the image based on the Shi and Thomasi algorithm [1]. The optical flow at each feature point is then estimated using the Lucas Kanade Pyramidal Optical Flow estimation algorithm [2]. The feature points are clustered and tracked on-line to find regions of the image with coherent movement. The appearance and disappearance of these coherent clusters indicates the start and end points of motion primitive segments. The algorithm performance is validated on full body motion video sequences, and compared to a joint-angle, motion capture based approach. The results show that the segmentation performance is comparable to the motion capture based approach, while using much simpler hardware and at a lower computational effort.;1050-4729;978-1-4244-2788-8;10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152266;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5152266;;"Image segmentation;Image motion analysis;Clustering algorithms;Optical computing;Humans;Kinematics;Computer vision;Tracking;Video sequences;Hardware";;8;;35;IEEE;06.

Myoelectric Control With Fixed Convolution-Based Time-Domain Feature Extraction: Exploring the Spatio–Temporal Interaction;"R. N. Khushaba; A. H. Al-Timemy; O. W. Samuel; E. J.

Nov 22;2022;52;6;1247;1257;The role of feature extraction in electromyogram (EMG) based pattern recognition has recently been emphasized with several publications promoting deep learning (DL) solutions that outperform traditional methods. It has been shown that the ability of DL models to extract temporal, spatial, and spatio–temporal information provides significant enhancements to the performance and generalizability of myoelectric control. Despite these advancements, it can be argued that DL models are computationally very expensive, requiring long training times, increased training data, and high computational resources, yielding solutions that may not yet be feasible for clinical translation given the available technology. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to leverage the benefits of spatio–temporal DL concepts into a computationally feasible and accurate traditional feature extraction method. Specifically, the proposed novel method extracts a set of well-known time-domain features into a matrix representation, convolves them with predetermined fixed filters, and temporally evolves the resulting features over a short and long-term basis to extract the EMG temporal dynamics. The proposed method, based on Fixed Spatio–Temporal Convolutions, offers significant reductions in the computational costs, while demonstrating a solution that can compete with, and even outperform, recent DL models. Experimental tests were performed on sparse-and high-density EMG (HD-EMG) signals databases, across a total of 44 subjects performing a maximum of 53 movements. Despite the simplification compared to deep approaches, our results show that the proposed solution significantly reduces the classification error rates by 3% to 10% in comparison to recent DL models, while being efficient for real-time implementations.;2168-2305;;10.1109/THMS.2022.3146053;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:82050410452); Shenzhen Governmental Basic Research(grant numbers:JCYJ20180507182508857); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9720722;"Convolutional neural networks (CNN);feature extraction;myoelectric signals;spatio-temporal models";"Feature extraction;Electromyography;Databases;Time-domain analysis;Convolution;Deep learning;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Spatiotemporal phenomena";;8;;44;IEEE;24.

This paper proposes a framework that would best solve the problem of automatic depression detection in depressed Saudi patients.

Nov 14;2014;20;12;2644;2653;In biomechanics studies, researchers collect, via experiments or simulations, datasets with hundreds or thousands of trials, each describing the same type of motion (e.g., a neck flexion-extension exercise) but under different conditions (e.g., different patients, different disease states, pre- and post-treatment). Analyzing similarities and differences across all of the trials in these collections is a major challenge. Visualizing a single trial at a time does not work, and the typical alternative of juxtaposing multiple trials in a single visual display leads to complex, difficult-to-interpret visualizations. We address this problem via a new strategy that organizes the analysis around motion trends rather than trials. This new strategy matches the cognitive approach that scientists would like to take when analyzing motion collections. We introduce several technical innovations making trend-centric motion visualization possible. First, an algorithm detects a motion collection's trends via time-dependent clustering. Second, a 2D graphical technique visualizes how trials leave and join trends. Third, a 3D graphical technique, using a median 3D motion plus a visual variance indicator, visualizes the biomechanics of the set of trials within each trend. These innovations are combined to create an interactive exploratory visualization tool, which we designed through an iterative process in collaboration with both domain scientists and a traditionally-trained graphic designer. We report on insights generated during this design process and demonstrate the tool's effectiveness via a validation study with synthetic data and feedback from expert musculoskeletal biomechanics researchers who used the tool to analyze the effects of disc degeneration on human spinal kinematics.;1941-0506;;10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346451;"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1054783); NIH/NIAMS(grant numbers:T32 AR050938,T32 AR056950); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875981;"Design studies;focus + context techniques;integrating spatial and non-spatial data visualization;visual design;biomedical and medical visualization";"Market research;Data visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Motion control;Biomechanics";"Algorithms;Biomechanical Phenomena;Computer Graphics;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Movement";11;;38;IEEE;06.

Sep 23;2023;;;669;676;Accurate position tracking of the leader vehicle is the key to the vehicle-following technology for the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), but there are still many challenges to implementing it in unstructured environments, especially in complex weather and rough terrain. This paper proposed a multi-sensor fusion system (MSFVT) to solve these problems. This system achieves a real-time and robust leader vehicle detection and tracking based on LiDAR, millimeter-wave Radar (MMW Radar), and inertial navigation unit (IMU)/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) fusion. The implementation of this system is divided into three steps: First, the point cloud from LiDAR is separated into different clusters based on an adaptive threshold clustering method and the clusters are classified using a support vector machine (SVM) to obtain the leader vehicle detection result. The detection result initializes the tracking process and maintains subsequent continuous tracking. Second, the validated detection results from MMW Radar obtained after multiple data filters are used to provide the position information of the leader vehicle during the UGV movement. Finally, the position of the tracking target in each sensor is converted to a global coordinate system using IMU/GNSS information and fed into the Kalman filter to estimate the motion of the tracking target. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we perform it in diverse unstructured environments. The experimental results show that our method has a smaller target position estimation error and an average processing frame rate of more than 40Hz.;;979-8-3503-2718-2;10.1109/RCAR58764.2023.10249734;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10249734;;"Support vector machines;Target tracking;Laser radar;Spaceborne radar;Vehicle detection;Radar detection;Radar tracking";;;;24;IEEE;20.

Feb 23;2023;31;;972;980;Due to physiological and anatomical variations across users, myoelectric interfaces trained by multiple users cannot be adapted to the unique hand movement patterns of the new user. Most current work requires the new user to provide one or more trials per gesture (dozens to hundreds of samples), applying domain adaptation methods to calibrate the model and achieve promising movement recognition performance. However, the user burden associated with time-consuming electromyography signal acquisition and annotation is a key factor hindering the practical application of myoelectric control. As shown in this work, once the number of calibration samples is reduced, the performance of previous cross-user myoelectric interfaces will degrade due to the lack of enough statistics to characterize the distributions. In this paper, a few-shot supervised domain adaptation (FSSDA) framework is proposed to address this issue. It aligns the distributions of different domains by calculating the distribution distances of point-wise surrogates. Specifically, we introduce a positive-negative pair distance loss to find a shared embedding subspace where each scarce sample from the new user will be closer to the positive samples and away from the negative samples of multiple users. Thus, FSSDA allows every target domain sample to be paired with all source domain samples and optimizes the feature distance between each target domain sample and the source domain samples within the same batch, instead of direct estimation of the data distribution of the target domain. The proposed method is validated on two high-density EMG datasets, which achieves the averaged recognition accuracies of 97.59% and 82.78% with only 5 samples per gesture. In addition, FSSDA is also effective even when only one sample per gesture is provided. The experimental results show that FSSDA greatly reduces the user burden and further facilitates the development of myoelectric pattern recognition techniques.;1558-0210;;10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3237181;"National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFF0501601); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:32271431,82272070,61922075); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:KY2100000123,WK2100000028); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M723055); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2019-025); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017271;"Electromyography (EMG);myoelectric pattern recognition;gesture recognition;few-shot domain adaptation";"Gesture recognition;Electromyography;Electrodes;Data models;Performance evaluation;Muscles;Convolutional neural networks";;2;;40;CCBY;16.

The IMUs were attached to a 3D printed spoon and a cup. Participants used them to mimic eating and drinking activities during data collection. For both activities, the ABP of frequency components from individuals with FRDA clustered in 0 to 0.2Hz band. This suggests that the ABP of this frequency is affected by FRDA irrespective of the device or activity. The ABP in this frequency band was used to distinguish between FRDA and non-ataxic participants using the Area Under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic Curve (AUC) which produced peak values greater than 0.8.

Aug 18;2017;;;330;333;"Strategies used by the central nervous system (CNS) for muscle recruitment and solving the question of abundancy are not still fully understood. Many observations suggest that the CNS overcomes the complexity of abundant number of muscles to be controlled using a dimension reduction policy based on developing muscle synergy groups. This will result in a modular control strategy, which is assumed to make the controlling task easier for the CNS. An important question in this field is how the synergy patterns may change during learning a new task. In this work, we assessed the effectiveness of modularity in describing muscle activity changes during learning. For this purpose, we designed a set of experiments comprising of two drawing tasks of spiral and circle based on tracking predefined patterns, on horizontal plane, by non-dominant arm. The drawing tasks were repeated in 5 different sessions (each session on a separate day) to observe the effect of training on learning. EMG signals from eight muscles of the non-dominant upper limb and the actual trajectory of the pen attached to the hand during drawing were collected. Data were recorded from six healthy participants. For kinematics evaluation of motor learning, the Inverse Efficiency Score (IES) was used in a different way compared to its original defined context, and it's decreasing trend indicated that learning has occurred. In addition, for evaluating the effect of motor learning on muscle activities, space-by-time decomposition model (unified method [1]) was applied to extract spatial and temporal synergies at the same time. Using the Variance Accounted For (VAF) criteria, four spatial and temporal synergies were the minimum necessary number of synergies necessary to re-generate the the EMG's. To study the effect of practice/learning, changes in synergy components over training sessions were evaluated. For all participants, in the last session, spatial synergy modules have become more similar(increasing trend with r2 = 0.9125). On the other hand, the temporal synergy modules, which represent the pattern of time in the EMG data, indicates more rhythmicity of the movement in the last session. The learning effect on the coefficient matrix was measured by the Pearson Correlation (PC) index; increasing trend of this index indicates that the coefficient matrix is converging to a constant matrix by passage of time.";;978-1-5386-3609-1;10.1109/ICBME.2017.8430286;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8430286;"Muscle Synergy;Learning;Electromyogram (EMG);spiral drawing;circle drawing";Biomedical engineering;;;;12;IEEE;09.

This large number of degrees of freedom imposes a significant control burden on the CNS. Previous studies suggested that the human cortex synchronizes a discrete number of neural functional units within the brainstem and spinal cord, i.e. muscle synergies, by linearly combining them to execute a great repertoire of movements. Further exploring this control mechanism, we aim to study whether a single set of muscle synergies might be generalized to express movements in different directions. This was implemented by using a modified version of the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm on EMG data sets of the upper extremity of healthy people. Our twelve participants executed hand-reaching movements in multiple directions. Muscle synergies that were extracted from movements to the center of the reaching space could be generalized to synergies for other movement directions. This finding was also supported by the application of a weighted correlation matrix, the similarity index and the results of the K-means cluster analysis. This might reinforce the notion that the CNS flexibly combines a single set of small number of synergies in different amplitudes to modulate movement for different directions.;1558-0210;;10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2769659;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8094297;"Muscle synergy;non-negative matrix factorization (NMF);motor control;electromyography (EMG);hand-reaching";"Muscles;Electromyography;Force;Spinal cord;Extremities;Indexes";"Aged;Algorithms;Biomechanical Phenomena;Electromyography;Female;Hand;Healthy Volunteers;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Muscle, Skeletal;Psychomotor Performance;Upper Extremity";24;;47;IEEE;02.

Aug 20;2020;;;3269;3272;Muscle synergy is a fundamental mechanism of motor control. Despite a number of studies focusing on muscle synergy during power grip and pinch at high-level force, relatively less is known about the functional interactions between muscles within low-level force production during precision pinch. Traditional analytical tools such as nonnegative matrix factorization or principal component analysis have limitations in processing nonlinear dynamic electromyographic signals and have confined sensitivity particularly for the low-level force production. In this study, we developed a novel method — multiplex muscle networks, to investigate the dynamical coordination of muscle activities at low-level force production during precision pinch. The multiplex muscle network was constructed based on multiplex limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph (MLPHVG). Seven forearm and hand muscles, including brachioradialis (BR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI), were examined using surface electromyography (sEMG). Eight healthy subjects were instructed to perform a visuomotor force tracking task by producing higher (10% MVC) and lower (1% MVC) precision pinch. Interlayer mutual information I, average edge overlap ω weighted clustering coefficient CW, weighted characteristic path length LW were selected as network metrics. We assessed the undirected weighted network generated from multiplex muscle network after taking the I between paired muscle network layers as edge. There are significant differences between higher and lower force level with higher I, ω, CW and lower LW at higher force level. Advanced efficiency of information processing in the regional and global perspective indicated dynamical alterations when human faces the higher force tracking task. It suggested that ω may be an important characteristic to classify different force control states with the average classification accuracy of 82.21%. These findings reveal related alterations of functional interactions between muscles involved in precision pinch. The novel method for constructing multiplex muscle network may provide insights into muscle synergies during precision pinch force control.;2694-0604;978-1-7281-1990-8;10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175447;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175447;;"Multiplexing;Sensitivity;Force;Production;Information processing;Muscles;Force control";"Electromyography;Forearm;Hand;Hand Strength;Humans;Muscle, Skeletal";2;;15;IEEE;27.

At each interval, data from 8 uniaxial accelerometers on the upper and lower limbs were recorded continuously, and subjects were videotaped. Features representing motion characteristics such as intensity, rate, regularity, and coordination were derived from the sensor data, and clinical scores were assigned for each task by review of the videotapes. Cluster analysis was performed on feature sets that were expected to reflect severity of parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. bradykinesia) and motor complications (e.g. dyskinesias). Two-dimensional data projections revealed clusters corresponding to the degree of dyskinesia and bradykinesia indicated by clinical scores. These preliminary results support our hypothesis that wearable sensors are sensitive to changing patterns of movement throughout the medication intake cycle, and that automated recognition of motor states using these recordings is feasible";1948-3554;0-7803-8710-4;10.1109/CNE.2005.1419591;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419591;;"Wearable sensors;Parkinson's disease;Medical diagnostic imaging;Fluctuations;Accelerometers;Optimization methods;Medical treatment;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Performance analysis;Pattern recognition";;6;5;13;IEEE;18.

When communications take place between wearable devices on two independently moving bodies, the body-to-body channel is considered, [3]. In this case, the antennas on both sides of the radio link are influenced by the presence of the body. The goal of this paper is to address the development of a flexible method to model radio channels in body-to-body communications. The model can be applied to any type of antenna, however, the radiation pattern of the antenna has to be previously modelled on the static body (e.g., voxel model) using full wave simulations, [4]. This ensures that the coupling of the body, which has an impact on the radiation pattern of antenna, is included. As the proposed model for body dynamics is based on motion capture analysis, [5], any type of body movement can be considered (e.g., run). The environment consists of clusters of scatterers, and the Geometrically Based Statistical Channel model adapted to the BANs is used, [6], to calculate Multi-Path Components (MPCs). The practical scenario of 2 bodies running in a street in an urban area (i.e., micro-cell) has been taken as a study case, Fig. 1. A patch antenna, [7], operating in the 2.45 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band is used. There are several typical placements of antennas in BANs, the following locations on both bodies being analysed: TO F and TO B (front and back side of the Chest); WA F (front side of the Waist); HE F, HE B, HE L and HE R (front, back, left and right side of the Head); AB L and AB R (left and right side of the Arm). This results in 81 possible body-to-body links. In order to model the street environment, a set of 10 clusters, of 3 scatterers each, has a uniform distribution in the half space of an ellipsoid. Two bodies are running in parallel on a straight line, in the middle of the street, with a 2 m separation between body centres. The running speed was set to 14.4 km/h. In order to obtain statistical parameters, each dynamic scenario has been repeated 30 times (for a random distribution of scatterers).";;978-1-4673-5225-3;10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929652;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6929652;;"Antenna radiation patterns;Wireless communication;Gain;Charge coupled devices;Channel models;Patch antennas";;5;;7;IEEE;20 Oct 2014;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

So far, many pose recognition methods and theories have been proposed. However, in the process of human pose recognition, misjudgment still occurs due to the interference within the class, similar movements and other external factors. In this paper, a DBLSTM neural network model is constructed based on the methods of deep learning and data fusion for the similar motion confusion problem in the human pose recognition process. The wearable motion capture device is used to take the kinematics data of the key nodes of the human body and fuse the data with the human skeleton data extracted from the video image by Openpose.

Firstly, high frequency detail coefficients of multilayer signals are obtained from original SEMG using the lifting wavelet decomposition with lifting algorithm. Then the coefficients are treated by the soft and the hard threshold method separately. Finally, a noise decreased signal is obtained through reconstructing the filtered coefficients. The de-noising experiments of standard sine adding noise signal and real SEMG are carried on. The results show that the lifting wavelet is an obvious better de-noising method compared to the first generation wavelet.

On the right, regions were grouped into a vestibular and pre-motor module, and into a visual-navigation module. On the left this last module was split into an inferior and superior component.

This paper takes subtle gestures as the research objects, and proposes a subtle gestures recognition system that uses two-channel sEMG signal and utilizes Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) which are parameter estimation classifiers based on probability density. First, combining the raw sEMG signal and the envelope sEMG signal, the number of channels for sensors and corresponding position of the muscle groups are preferably selected. Then, we propose to use the Pearson correlation coefficient to optimize the four types of features extracted in the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and AR model parameters, which effectively ensures the uniqueness of each gesture and eliminates individual differences.

Sep 13;2013;43;5;1357;1369;The recent advancement of motion recognition using Microsoft Kinect stimulates many new ideas in motion capture and virtual reality applications. Utilizing a pattern recognition algorithm, Kinect can determine the positions of different body parts from the user. However, due to the use of a single-depth camera, recognition accuracy drops significantly when the parts are occluded. This hugely limits the usability of applications that involve interaction with external objects, such as sport training or exercising systems. The problem becomes more critical when Kinect incorrectly perceives body parts. This is because applications have limited information about the recognition correctness, and using those parts to synthesize body postures would result in serious visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new method to reconstruct valid movement from incomplete and noisy postures captured by Kinect. We first design a set of measurements that objectively evaluates the degree of reliability on each tracked body part. By incorporating the reliability estimation into a motion database query during run time, we obtain a set of similar postures that are kinematically valid. These postures are used to construct a latent space, which is known as the natural posture space in our system, with local principle component analysis. We finally apply frame-based optimization in the space to synthesize a new posture that closely resembles the true user posture while satisfying kinematic constraints. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the quality of the recognized posture under severely occluded environments, such as a person exercising with a basketball or moving in a small room.;2168-2275;;10.1109/TCYB.2013.2275945;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6584796;"Human–computer interaction;Kinect;local principal component analysis;posture reconstruction";"Reliability;Tracking;Kinematics;Principal component analysis;Image reconstruction;Databases;Training";"Actigraphy;Actigraphy;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Peripherals;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Posture;Transducers;Video Games;Whole Body Imaging;Whole Body Imaging";105;4;46;IEEE;22.

A phone-size HMM-based inversion mapping is employed and trained in a semi-supervised fashion. The advantage of the use of articulatory features is that they can drive the lips motions and they have a close link with head movements. Speech inversion normally requires the training data recorded with electromagnetic articulograph (EMA), which restricts the naturalness of head movements. The present study considers a more realistic recording condition where the training data for the target speaker are recorded with a usual motion capture system rather than EMA. Different temporal clustering techniques are investigated for HMM-based mapping as well as a GMM-based frame-wise mapping as a baseline system. Objective and subjective experiments show that the synthesised motions are more natural using an HMM system than a GMM one, and estimated EMA features outperform prosodic features.;2379-190X;978-1-4799-2893-4;10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854468;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854468;"inversion mapping;clustering;head motion synthesis";"Hidden Markov models;Speech;Magnetic heads;Motion segmentation;Animation;Lips;Acoustics";;7;;23;IEEE;14.

Traditional muscle activity measurement methods, such as electromyography (EMG), are unsuitable for long-term or intense exercise measurements. Hence, we focused on biosignals originating from tendons connected to muscles, which have been found to correlate with muscle activity. A preliminary experiment confirmed the presence of these biosignals and revealed a correlation between piezoelectric film sensor data and exerted muscle force. We conducted data acquisition experiments and data analysis to investigate this relationship further.Data collection experiments were performed on 63 participants (31 males and 32 females). High-sensitivity piezoelectric film sensors were placed near the ankle joints of the participants, who then performed isometric contraction exercises. The obtained data was used to extract features and construct longitudinal data. In our data analysis, we extracted typical data through clustering techniques. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, we identified a linear latent curve model (LCM) that fit our data appropriately. Upon examining the model characteristics by gender, it was observed that both males and females showed a monotonic increase in biosignals with increasing exerted muscle force. A t-test on intercepts revealed significant differences between males and females; female intercepts tended to be lower, while male intercepts were higher. However, no significant difference was observed in slopes between genders via t-test.These findings could enable personalized movement control and rehabilitation approaches, improving quality of life. Future research will identify factors causing inter-subject differences and construct individualized models for estimating exerted muscle force based on specific biosignals.";;979-8-3503-9452-8;10.1109/ACDSA59508.2024.10467689;;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10467689;"Muscle activity;biomechanical signal analysis;structural equation modeling;longitudinal data;latent curve model;piezoelectric film sensor";"Data analysis;Biological system modeling;Force;Muscles;Feature extraction;Mathematical models;Data models";;;;23;IEEE;20 Mar 2024;;;IEEE;IEEE Conferences

When it comes to the performing arts, and mainly dance and kinesiology, the massive amounts of RGB-D and 3D skeleton data produced by video and motion capture devices the huge number of different types of existing dances and variations thereof, dictate the need for organizing, indexing, archiving, retrieving and analyzing dance-related cultural content in a tractable fashion and with lower computational and storage resource requirements. In this context, we present a novel framework based on kinematics modeling for the extraction of salient 3D human motion data from real-world choreographic sequences. Two approaches are proposed: a clustering-based method for the selection of the basic primitives of a choreography, and a kinematics-based method that generates meaningful summaries at hierarchical levels of granularity.

As fingerprinting-based methods rely on ubiquitous information in buildings, the need for additional infrastructure is discarded. Still, the time-consuming manual process to acquire fingerprints limits their applicability in most scenarios. This paper proposes an algorithm for the automatic construction of environmental fingerprints on multi-storey buildings, leveraging the information sources available in each scenario. It relies on unlabelled crowdsourced data from users’ smartphones. With only the floor plans as input, a demand for most applications, we apply a multimodal approach that joins inertial data, local magnetic field and Wi-Fi signals to construct highly accurate fingerprints. Precise movement estimation is achieved regardless of smartphone usage through Deep Neural Networks, and the transition between floors detected from barometric data. Users’ trajectories obtained with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning techniques are partitioned into clusters with Wi-Fi measurements. Straight sections from the same cluster are then compared with subsequence Dynamic Time Warping to search for similarities. From the identified overlapping sections, a particle filter fits each trajectory into the building’s floor plans. From all successfully mapped routes, fingerprints labelled with physical locations are finally obtained. Experimental results from an office and a university building show that this solution constructs comparable fingerprints to those acquired manually, thus providing a useful tool for fingerprinting-based solutions automatic setup.;2169-3536;;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060123;"project Geolocation non-Assisted by GPS for Mobile Networks in Indoor and Outdoor Environment (GARMIO), co-funded by Portugal 2020, framed through the COMPETE 2020 (Operational Programme Competitiveness and Internationalization) and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) from European Union (EU)(grant numbers:POCI-01-0247-FEDER-033479); ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358191;"Crowdsourcing;fingerprinting;indoor location;inertial tracking;magnetic field;multi-storey;unsupervised;Wi-Fi";"Wireless fidelity;Crowdsourcing;Buildings;Trajectory;Sensors;Smart phones;IP networks";;14;;32;CCBY;19.

This is new in the literature and enables novel applications. Second, our method allows simple calibrations to align the gaze pattern to any gaze target. This is much simpler than conventional calibrations which rely on sufficient training data to compute person and scene-specific nonlinear gaze mappings.

Apr 20;2020;24;4;1016;1027;Objective: To provide objective visualization and pattern analysis of neck muscle boundaries to inform and monitor treatment of cervical dystonia. Methods: We recorded transverse cervical ultrasound (US) images and whole-body motion analysis of sixty-one standing participants (35 cervical dystonia, 26 age matched controls). We manually annotated 3,272 US images sampling posture and the functional range of pitch, yaw, and roll head movements. Using previously validated methods, we used 60-fold cross validation to train, validate and test a deep neural network (U-net) to classify pixels to 13 categories (five paired neck muscles, skin, ligamentum nuchae, vertebra). For all participants for their normal standing posture, we segmented US images and classified condition (Dystonia/Control), sex and age (higher/lower) from segment boundaries. We performed an explanatory, visualization analysis of dystonia muscle-boundaries. Results: For all segments, agreement with manual labels was Dice Coefficient (64 ± 21%) and Hausdorff Distance (5.7 ± 4 mm). For deep muscle layers, boundaries predicted central injection sites with average precision 94 ± 3%. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, a support-vector-machine classified condition, sex, and age from predicted muscle boundaries at accuracy 70.5%, 67.2%, 52.4% respectively, exceeding classification by manual labels. From muscle boundaries, Dystonia clustered optimally into three sub-groups. These sub-groups are visualized and explained by three eigen-patterns which correlate significantly with truncal and head posture. Conclusion: Using US, neck muscle shape alone discriminates dystonia from healthy controls.

Our approach predicts TTC and optical flow from monocular images and identifies potential collision areas using feature clustering and motion analysis.

Jan 24;2024;73;;1;17;Estimating the 3-D human poses of multiple individuals using multiple cameras is a significant research topic within the field of vision-based measurement. Contrary to the classical outside-in camera capture system, the inside-out panoramic camera capture system can cover larger scenes with fewer cameras for 3-D human pose estimation. This advancement extends the application of 3-D human pose measurement beyond small spaces like motion capture studios. For example, this approach can be utilized for intelligent security surveillance in broad outdoor squares or capturing athletes’ movements in large-scale sports scenes. However, existing inside-out 3-D human pose estimation methods that utilize panoramic cameras encounter challenges, particularly in multiperson occlusion scenarios. Aimed at these problems, this article presents a novel inside-out multiperson 3-D human pose estimation method using just a few calibrated panoramic cameras. Specifically, we first propose a cross-view multiperson matching algorithm based on panoramic camera epipolar geometry constraint to improve human body matching robustness across viewpoints. Then, we take advantage of multiple panoramic cameras and introduce a multiview human pose clustering and fusion algorithm to improve the average recall (AR) of 3-D human pose estimation.

In this paper, an adaptive multipopulation framework is proposed to address this issue. A database is designed to collect heuristic information of algorithm behavior changes. The number of populations is adjusted according to statistical information related to the current evolving status in the database and a heuristic value. Several other techniques are also introduced, including a heuristic clustering method, a population exclusion scheme, a population hibernation scheme, two movement schemes, and a peak hiding method. The particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithms are implemented into the framework, respectively. A set of multipopulation-based algorithms are chosen to compare with the proposed algorithms on the moving peaks benchmark using four different performance measures. The effect of the components of the framework is also investigated based on a set of multimodal problems in static environments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the other algorithms in most scenarios.;1941-0026;;10.1109/TEVC.2015.2504383;"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61203306,61305086); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of U.K.(grant numbers:EP/K001310/1); British Council UK-ASEAN Knowledge Partnership Grant; British Council Newton Institutional Links Grant; ";https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7339694;"Dynamic optimization;multimodal optimization;multipopulation optimization;population adaptation";"Sociology;Statistics;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Clustering algorithms;Databases;Change detection algorithms";;72;;46;IEEE;30.
